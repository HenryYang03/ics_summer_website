## What We advertised

- In God We Trust. All Others Bring Data. — Edward Deming.

<!-- This quote is widely attributed to Deming.
He was referring to the use of data to improve manufacturing quality back to the eighties.
The quote has new interpretations in the big data era. 
Data are important. But they are not useful unless we know how to interpret it and get scientific insights from it using appropriate statisitcal and computational methods. 
Of course we care a lot about students' experiences.
