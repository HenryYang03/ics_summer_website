## What is Data Science?

- **Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge and insights from data.
- It combines:
  - **Statistics**: The science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data.
  - **Computer Science**: Algorithms, machine learning, data processing, and software engineering.
  - **Domain Expertise**: Specific knowledge about the field from which the data is drawn.



## Data Science Life Cycle
- Data Science involves several key processes:
  - **Define A Scientific Problem**
  - **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
  - **Data Cleaning/Reprocessing**: Preparing data for analysis by removing or correcting errors.


##  Data Science Life Cycle
- Data Science involves several key processes:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Summarizing the main characteristics, often using visual methods.
  - **Modeling and Inference**: Involving at least one of the following: estimation, testing, prediction.
  - **Interpretation and Conclusion**: Translating data findings into actionable business or research insights.


## Statistical Inference
- To learn an entire population, we collect data.  

- It's important to note that characteristics, relationships, and realities of the entire population are generally unknown.

- Consequently, there is inherent uncertainty in our conclusions.

- Probability serves as the fundamental tool in Statistics to quantify and manage this uncertainty.

## Statistical Inference
- Statistical inference is the process of using data to draw conclusions about the entire population.

- This knowledge helps us make decisions related to the scientific problem that drove our study and data analysis.

- In this program, we'll cover essential statistical inference methods and how to apply them to practical problems.

- First, we'll focus on understanding and exploring (and describing) the data .



## Case Study 1: Poverty and Students' performance
- Define the problem
- Data source: California Department of Education Database
  - Key variables: poverty, performance
  - data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Modeling and inference
- Conclusion
- This one of the several capstone projects for this session

## case study 2: Cognitive Status and brain volume
- A subset of data from the **Uniform Data Set** of National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center (NACC)
- Measurements of brain volume
- Cognitive status: normal cognition (0), mild cognitive impairment due to AD (1), or dementia due to AD (2)
- Other important information, such as age and gender
- We will be using this data set to illustrate how to use different statistical methods to address questions in data science
